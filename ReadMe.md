In ATC02.py the entire code is present

1. The input has to be given in main()
2. Enter number of variables in n 
3. Enter the input expression in the 'exp' variable
    The input must be like X[1] + x[2] <= 5 if expression is like x1+x2<=5
    since the declaration of z3 variables has to done before assigning an expression, so I have modified my code such that it can work for any number of variables where n = no. of variables, and exp = expression of the form as stated above.
4. Enter the values of x1, x2, x3 in values like values = [1, 3, 4] if x1=1, x2=3, x3=4
5. After you input n, exp and values, you can run the file with the required functions as listed below. Uncomment the function you want to use and run the file.
6. Error state is represented as -100.
7. Uncomment Q5_solving_function() to get the result of given expression
